The dataset used in this project focuses on car sales advertisements. The aim is to investigate, evaluate, and visualize key factors that impact car selling prices. By analyzing this dataset, the project seeks to reveal trends and insights that can assist stakeholders, including car manufacturers, dealers, and buyers, in making well-informed decisions.

The requirements file contains the technologies and libraries which includes:

Python: The primary programming language employed for the project.
Pandas: Used for manipulating and analyzing data.
Streamlit: Helps build an interactive dashboard for the web application.
Plotly Express: A plotting library used for creating visualizations.'

The vehicles file contain the details of the cars which includes the columns:

Price: The price at which the car is selling.
Model Year: The year in which the car was manufactured.
Model: The specific model of the car produced by the manufacturer (e.g., Sorento, Mustang, Camry).
Transmission: The type of transmission in the car, typically automatic or manual.
Condition: A representation of the overall condition of the car.
Odometer: The number of miles recorded on the car's odometer at the time of sale.
Paint color: The exterior color of the car (e.g., white, black, red).
Cylinder: How many cylinders the vehicle contains.
Fuel: Whether it is a gas or diesel engine.
Type: The type of vehicle(i.e, SUV,Sedan,Pickup)
Is 4wd: Whether it is 4wd or 2wd.
Date posted: The date at which the car is posted is selling.
Days listed: For how many days the vehicle has been posted.

The EDA file provides an in-depth exploration and analysis of the car sales advertisement dataset. Its purpose is to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data, forming the foundation for further insights and visualizations.

Key Components:

Dataset Overview: An initial understanding of the dataset, including structure, feature descriptions, and data types.
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to prepare the data for analysis.
Feature Analysis:
Distribution of key features, such as price, odometer readings.
Relationships between features like price vs. odometer readings and price distribution.
Visualizations: Histograms, scatter plots.
Summary: Insights gained from the analysis that inform subsequent modeling and decision-making.
The EDA file ensures transparency and serves as a critical step in the data pipeline, providing a comprehensive understanding of the dataset and guiding the project forward.

Running the EDA:
Open the EDA.ipynb file in a Jupyter Notebook or a compatible environment.
Execute the notebook cells to explore the data, visualize key insights, and prepare the dataset for further steps.
